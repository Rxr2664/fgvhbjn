## Problem Description

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming data through missing value imputation, outlier detection, and text preprocessing for NLP.

---

## Techniques Used

- Mean and KNN Imputation
- IQR and Z-Score Outlier Handling
- Regex-based cleaning for text
- TF-IDF and CountVectorizer for featurization

---

## Review Comments

- `# REVIEW COMMENT`: Mean imputation may distort distributions; KNN preserves structure.
- `# REVIEW COMMENT`: IQR is more robust for skewed data; Z-score is sensitive to outliers.
- `# REVIEW COMMENT`: TF-IDF helps highlight rare but relevant words.
